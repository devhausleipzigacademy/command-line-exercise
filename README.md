# Command Line Exercise

This repository is a mess. Use `cp` `mv` `mkdir` and `rm` to cleanup.
Try using wildcards when working with the javascript and image files.

Here are some of the things to do:

- Rename inddex.html and style.ccs
- Rename DOCS to docs
- Remove the asdf file in the img folder
- Remove the \_\_old\_\_ directory
- Copy the LICENSE file to both the docs folder and the root folder
- Move the javascript files into a new directory called js inside assets
- Move all images into the img folder
- Move the style.css file into a new directory called css inside the assets directory.
- Move the .gitignore file to the root directory

Here's the target directory structure

```
/assets/img/background.png

/assets/js/slider.js
